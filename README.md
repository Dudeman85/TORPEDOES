# TORPEDOES & UnEngine

## TORPEDOES!!! The Game

TORPEDOES!!! is an isometric racing game inspired by retro racing games such as RC Pro-Am. Up to four players can select one of four warships with different weapons and abilities to race each other to the finish line.

This game was made entirely with UnEngine for a custom built arcade machine. It is also playable on PC with normal controllers.

## UnEngine

**This engine is very much still in-dev and should not be used as components will be changed and deprecated.**<br>

This is a 2D game engine made from scratch. It is built on a custom implementation of [Entity Component System (ECS)](doc/Class%20References/ECS%20Reference.md).
